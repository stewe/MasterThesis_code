TODO
 - request: receive n or max. t seconds old messages
 - write a rust program for requesting the cache (use cache-client) -> first msg contains number, when they
    are all received, measure time;
 - multiple exp. iterations; parallel requests? -> throughput!





Experiments
    throughput
     - requests per second as a function of a) number of values b) size of cached values/msgs )
     - values per second
     - how many subscriptions? -> frequency of publications
     - single threaded vs. concurrent
     - zmq high water mark: default: 1000; publisher drops the rest; may influence the result/throughput

    latency
