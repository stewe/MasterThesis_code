 - experiments latency: fixed size = facebook average size
 - experiments: loop in script, finish latency!

 - multiple exp. iterations; parallel requests? -> throughput!





Experiments
    throughput
     - requests per second as a function of a) number of values b) size of cached values/msgs )
     - values per second
     - how many subscriptions? -> frequency of publications
     - single threaded vs. concurrent
     - zmq high water mark: default: 1000; publisher drops the rest; may influence the result/throughput
